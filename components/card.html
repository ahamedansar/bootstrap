    <p class="card-text">Spider-Man is a superhero from Marvel Comics. His real name is Peter Parker. He got his powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. He can climb walls, swing with webs, has super strength, and a “spider-sense” that warns him of danger.
He fights villains like Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom, while also handling his normal life as a student and later as a young man. His famous lesson is:
“With great power comes great responsibility.”</p>
